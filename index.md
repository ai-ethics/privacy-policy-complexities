### Abstract 

Given the extensive coverage that privacy gets in popular media and how many of us fear for how our personal data might be used in nefarious ways, our research project is embarking on unearthing if there exist discrepancies between the expressed privacy concerns and the behaviours exhibited by consumers when it comes to the protection of their personal data.

**More details on the operational nature of this research project are forthcoming.**
